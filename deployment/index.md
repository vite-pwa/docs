# Getting Started

Since you need to install your application as a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps), you must configure your server to meet [PWA Minimal Requirements](/guide/pwa-minimal-requirements), that is, your server **must**:
- serve `manifest.webmanifest` with `application/manifest+json` mime type
- you must serve your application over `https`
- you must redirect from `http` to `https`

## Cache-Control

Ensure you have a very restrictive setup for your `Cache-Control` headers in place.

Double check that **you do not** have caching features enabled, especially `immutable`, on locations like:
- `/`
- `/sw.js`
- `/index.html`
- `/manifest.webmanifest`

::: danger
**Always re-test and re-assure** that the caching for mission critical files is **as low** as possible if not hashed files or you might invalidate clients for a long time.

## Servers

- [Netlify](/deployment/netlify)
- [AWS Amplify](/deployment/aws)
- [Vercel](/deployment/vercel)
- [NGINX](/deployment/nginx)
- [Apache Http Server 2.4+](/deployment/apache)

## Testing your application on production

Once you deploy your application to your server, you can test it using [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/).

There are many test sites, but we suggest you use `WebPageTest` as this is the most comprehensive in terms of test:
- Security.
- First byte time.
- Keep alive enabled.
- Compress transfer.
- Cache static content.
- Effective use of CDN.
- Lighthouse: Core Web Vitals, Performance, Images size optimization...
- And more...

Enter the url of your application, click `Start Test` button, wait for the test to finish, the `WebPageTest` result will hint you what things on your application must be fixed/changed. The `WebPageTest` result will also score your application, it will also test your site with `Lighthouse`.

For example, go to [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), enter `https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/`, click `Start Test` button, wait a few seconds for the test to finish, and see the results for this site.
